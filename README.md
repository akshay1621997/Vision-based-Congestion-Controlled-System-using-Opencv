# Vision-based-Congestion-Controlled-System-using-Opencv
Traffic is a major area of concern in recent times. With the increase in the number of vehicles being used, the problem of controlling traffic is getting tedious day-by-day. Time and fuel are wasted because of traffic congestions. According to an article published in the Times of India, congestion in major cities like Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata, and Bangalore costs the economy Rs.1.47 lakh crore annually. Intelligent Transport System is a new application which is aiming at better ways of managing transport and traffic. Google Maps is one such system which provides information about the status of traffic at a place. But one of the disadvantages with google maps is that it does not give a clear idea of the number of vehicles present at that place. This project aims to overcome the disadvantages that are present in the existing systems. The main advantage of this system is that real-time images can be captured and uploaded to the cloud which proves to be very useful in providing information about traffic updates.
